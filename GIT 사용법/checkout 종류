checkout 종류

If your local changes are going to be overwritten by checkout,
IntelliJ IDEA displays a list of files that prevent you from checking out the selected branch,
and suggests choosing between Force Checkout and Smart Checkout.

If you click Force Checkout, your local uncommitted changes will be overwritten,
and you will lose them.

If you click Smart Checkout, IntelliJ IDEA will shelve uncommitted changes,
check out the selected branch, and then unshelve the changes.  d
If a conflict occurs during the unshelve operation, you will be prompted to merge the changes. 
For details, see Resolve conflicts.
